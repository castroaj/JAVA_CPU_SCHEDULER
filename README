Name:

sched

Description:

Reads input from stdin that lists all processes - one per line. For each 
process, there are 5 entries representing the process':

o PID
o Priority (1=highest, 10=lowest)
o Arrival time
o Burst time
o Total ticks need to finish

The program runs a scheduling simulation of the processes using 
non-preemptive FCFS, preemptive priority, and round robin (with a time 
quantum of 10 ticks). The program then prints out the following 
statistics:

o CPU utilization
o Average response time
o Average turnaround time
o Start and end time of each process

Compiling:

make

Running:

./sched [DEBUG]

If the DEBUG flag is given on the command line the program will print 
out debugging information.

Known Bugs:

None.
